1)Static and dynamic programming:-

Static programming involves writing code that remains unchanged during runtime, like basic scripts or simple algorithms.

Dynamic programming involves optimizing code by breaking down a problem into smaller subproblems and storing solutions to avoid redundant calculations, often used for complex problems like optimization or finding the shortest path.

2)way indexing start with zero every programming language:-

In programming, indexing starts at 0 because it aligns with how memory addresses work. It's like counting from the beginning of a list where the first item is at position 0, making it simpler for computers to manage and access data.

3)use case of list in real time :-

In programming, indexing starts at 0 because it aligns with how memory addresses work. It's like counting from the beginning of a list where the first item is at position 0, making it simpler for computers to manage and access data.
